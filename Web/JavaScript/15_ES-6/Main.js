//? ES 6 stands for ecma script. Javascript is made on the basis of ecma script. Any changes or modification done in Ecma Script, was
//? even added in Javascript, as Js was a follow up or you can say built on the basis of ES-6.

//! But why only ES 6 and why not ES 1, ES 2, .... 
//? This is because, ES 6 was a major update. In this update, 2 new keywords - let and const were added. This has been discussed
//? earlier. Also function like arrow function were added. This revolutionised Javascript and nowadays, any framework like
//? React, Angular, Vue, etc works on these function. This frameworks cannot be learnt without ES 6.
