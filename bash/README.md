# Bash Scripting

Bash scripting refers to the process of writing and executing scripts using the Bash (Bourne Again SHell) language. Bash is a command-line interpreter that is widely used in `Unix-like operating systems`, including `Linux` and `macOS`.

**Bash scripts are used to automate tasks and perform various operations on the command line. They can be used to write simple scripts for executing a series of commands or complex scripts for system administration, software deployment, and more**.

In bash scripting, you can define variables, perform arithmetic operations, use conditional statements, implement loops, handle input/output, and create functions. Bash scripts are typically saved with a `.sh` extension and can be executed directly from the command line.

By learning bash scripting, you can enhance your productivity, automate repetitive tasks, and have better control over your system. This course will guide you through the fundamentals of bash scripting and provide hands-on examples to help you become proficient in writing bash scripts.
